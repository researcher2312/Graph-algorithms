Project made for university, for Algorithm Design and Artificial Intelligence Methods subject

It creates graphs, both with vertice arrays and adjacent vertice lists. Graph sizes are: 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000 elements and they are filled in 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%.

All containers and abstract data types are written by me especially for this project, so they contain a lot of simplifications.

For each case 100 tests are run and the result is the average of them.
Running times are shown in console, printed from stderr.
This only works on linux machines because of using sys/time.h
